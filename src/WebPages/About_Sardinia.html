                Sardinia is politically a region of Italy, whose official name is
                Regione Autonoma della Sardegna / Regione Autònoma de Sardigna (Autonomous Region of Sardinia),
                and enjoys some degree of domestic autonomy granted by a specific Statute. It is divided into
                four provinces and a metropolitan city, with Cagliari being the region's capital and its largest city
                as well.
                Sardinia's indigenous language and the other minority languages (Sassarese, Corsican Gallurese,
                Algherese Catalan and Ligurian Tabarchino) spoken on the island are recognized by the regional
                law and enjoy "equal dignity" with Italian.

                Our primitive forebears may have been wandering around Sardinia as long as 400,000 years ago. Their
                Bronze Age
                descendants, known as the nuraghic peoples, long dominated the interior of the island, even after the
                arrival of
                Phoenician traders around 850 BC, subsequently to be replaced by the Carthaginians and Romans. The
                latter eventually
                took control of much of the island and the indigenous people faded into history.

                <li> Sardinia’s coastline measures over 1850km long and makes up a quarter of the total length of the
                    Italian coastline.</li>

                <li>The island has an above average life expectancy of 81 years, and has the highest rate of
                    centenarians
                    in the world, with there being 22 people aged over 100 per 100,000 inhabitants.</li>

                <li>he famous scene in The Spy Who Loved Me where James Bond drives a Lotus Esprit out of the sea was
                    filmed on Sardinia’s Costa Smerald in 1977.</li>

                <li>It is the only region of Italy to not have a motorway – a great indication of the island’s relaxed
                    pace of life! </li>
