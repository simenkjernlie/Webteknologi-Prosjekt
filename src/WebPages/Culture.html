                    Cannonau is the wine synonymous with Sardinia. The grape is grown all over this island, a special variety of 
                    what is generally known as grenache, producing explosive, potent wines. The great majority of the vineyards, 
                    and the highest-quality wines, are produced in a triangle that stretches along an idyllic coastline from Orosei 
                    to Bari Sardo, and then into the wild mountainous interiors as far as Atzara

                    Sardinia has an ancient history for you to discover with Roman ruins and Nuraghi (mysterious stone dwellings or 
                    fortresses dating back 3,500 years), found throughout the island as a permanent reminder of its prehistoric occupation. 
                    There are numerous examples of Roman architecture as a catalogue of their dominance, ancient villages with a varied history 
                    to explore and archaeological sites to visit.

                        In Sardinia, the best place to look out for good local produce is without doubt the open-air, farmers' markets. 
                        These are held in the mornings on different days of the week throughout the island. Our local representatives will 
                        be able to provide you with details of any market held near you. From spring time and onwards there is an abundance of 
                        fresh local produce in the markets, shops and on the road side stalls. Strawberries are the first fruits of the 
                        summer and are quickly followed by apricots.

                        In the province of Oristano, in the central-western part of Sardinia, on the top of a hill, sits one of the most 
                        significant examples of Romanesque architecture in the island and in the entire Sardinian artistic heritage, 
                        a majestic building from the first half of the 12th century.It melts your heart at first sight. The church appears 
                        in all its majesty rather unexpectedly, on a hillock in the main street of Santa Giusta, at the end of a majestic set 
                        of stairs: a gem of Romanesque architecture, model for nearby churches, including San Pietro di Terralba.
