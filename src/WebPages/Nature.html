                    Sardinia’s snow-white beaches and bluer-than-blue seas are often likened to the Caribbean – but why, 
                    quite frankly, would you want to imagine yourself anywhere else? <br/> Best for escapists: Is Aruttas
                    Spearing into the Golfo di Oristano, the beaches on the Sinis Peninsula rank among the island’s loveliest, 
                    though ideally you need your own car to reach them. <br/> Best for families: Chia
                    To see what all the fuss is about, head up to the Spanish watchtower and look down on its pretty pair of beaches 
                    – Spiaggia Sa Colonia to the west, horseshoe-shaped Spiaggia Su Portu to the east. Both have pale sands and 
                    shallow waters. Flamingos wade in the lagoon behind the beach.

                    The Gennargentu Mountains are a Sardinian National Park on the central east side of Sardinia. 
                    The park, situated in a vast territory with some of the most unspoiled and wild mountains of the island.
                    The highest peak is Punta della Marmora, 1834 meters tall, the island’s tallest mountain. Near the 
                    Supramonte are the pretty mountain villages of Oliena, Orgosolo and Dorgali. Rare wild flowers, aromatic shrubs, 
                    mouflon wild sheep, wild boars, red foxes, eagles and the Griffon vultures, and very beautiful butterflies make this 
                    mountain a real open air paradise. The Gennargentu mountains and the Supramonte are the favorite Sardinian 
                    destinations for those who are fond of speleology, hiking and climbing.

                    Since the 50’s, the main attraction of Cala Gonone has been the “Grotta del Bue Marino”.
                    Since then it has been admired by millions of tourists. The queen of this cave was in 
                    fact the “marine ox": so, popular imagination named it the monk seal because of its awkward 
                    shape and warm behaviour. The visit inside lasts about an hour, during which experienced guides 
                    are available to provide scientific and historical information about the cave and the wildlife 
                    that inhabited it. If you choose to only visit the “Grotta del Bue Marino”, the total duration of 
                    the excursion is approximately 2 hours including the return journey and the visit inside (duration 1 hour).
